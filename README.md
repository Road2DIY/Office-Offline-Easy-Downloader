# Office-Offline-Easy-Downloader
Easy downloader Office 2019, 2021, 2024 Offline and install

This is a quick powershell script as Microsoft seemed to have hidden the ability to download Office 2019, 2021, and 2024 installers and forcing everyone to the 365 variants.

This script assumes you have already downloaded the ODT and have it setup.exe located within the ODT folder.

I will update the readme when I have more time
